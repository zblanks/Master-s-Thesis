\chapter{Experiments and Analysis}
In this chapter I will provide details on each of the benchmark experiments that we performed to validate the performance of the HC: CIFAR, the Stanford Dogs data, Reddit data, and FMOW. In particular I will describe the general steps that we took for all of the data: namely that we bootstrapped the training $50$ times to allow us to get a distribution of estimator performance, we ran the analysis with a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest classifier. I will justify these decisions both in the context of demonstrating robustness of results and also from a computational perspective. Finally, 

\section{CIFAR}
In this section I will describe the CIFAR data, and the experiments that we performed. The purpose of this first benchmark is to demonstrate how HCs, in general, can be used to get superior performance relative to a FC

\subsection{Data Description}
In this section I will describe where the CIFAR data comes from, how we generated new features using the NASNet as described in Chapter 2, and provide some sort of image (maybe a deep dream or something) which will help the reader understand what the data looks like.
